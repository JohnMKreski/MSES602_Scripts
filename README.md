# MSES602 – DevOps Lab Assignments

This repository contains my **lab assignments for MSES602 (DevOps)** at Regis University. It serves as a consolidated workspace for hands-on exercises focused on **automation, system inspection, and infrastructure tooling**, rather than a single-purpose project.

Course materials and reference utilities provided by Regis University can be found here:

## Repository Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:

* Maintain one organized location for all MSES602 lab work
* Track incremental learning across multiple DevOps-related topics
* Capture both working artifacts (scripts, playbooks) and written reflections

Labs are organized by number and evolve as concepts build throughout the course.

## Lab Structure

```text
labs/
├── lab01/        # Python scripting and system inspection
├── lab02/        # Ansible + Jenkins automation
└── labXX/        # Future labs
```

Each lab directory typically contains:

* A `.md` with the lab write-up and reflection
* Supporting assets (screenshots, diagrams)
* Lab-specific code or configuration files

---

## [Lab 1 – Python Scripting Basics](labs/lab01/lab1.md)

Lab 1 focuses on using Python for operational and system-level tasks, emphasizing safe inspection and understanding over complex automation.

Topics include:

* Reading system state (uptime, CPU, memory)
* Basic network reachability checks
* Auditing local Linux user accounts (read-only)

The intent is to learn how scripting supports DevOps workflows without treating scripts as black boxes.

---

## [Lab 2 – Ansible and Jenkins Automation](labs/lab02/lab2.md)

Lab 2 introduces configuration management and CI tooling using Ansible to provision Jenkins on a headless Linux server.

Topics include:

* Infrastructure as Code concepts
* Package management and service control with Ansible
* Secure repository and GPG key handling
* Jenkins installation, initial configuration, and plugin review

This lab highlights the difference between provisioning tools (Ansible) and continuous automation platforms (Jenkins).

---

## Supporting Scripts

Reusable or general-purpose scripts may appear outside individual lab folders, such as:

* Environment validation helpers
* Utility scripts reused across labs

These are kept separate from lab-specific artifacts to avoid duplication.

---

## Prerequisites

* Linux system (tested primarily on Ubuntu Server)
* Python 3 installed from system packages
* Internet access (for package installation where required)

Most scripts rely primarily on Python’s standard library. Third-party dependencies, when used, are documented explicitly.

---

## Learning Philosophy

This repository reflects a learning-first DevOps approach:

* Emphasis on understanding system behavior
* Preference for safe, non-destructive operations
* Incremental adoption of tooling and best practices
* Acceptance that solutions evolve as experience grows

The repository is intentionally structured to support experimentation, revision, and reflection rather than rigid step-following.

## AI Additional Tools

ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot were used as supplemental tools for research, documentation review, and scripting assistance, consistent with common professional DevOps and software engineering workflows.
